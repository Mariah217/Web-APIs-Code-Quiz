# Code Quiz Challenge!

## Description
This website allows you to click start quiz and answer 5 coding questions. You have a total of 75 seconds to complete the quiz. Each time a question is answered incorrectly, the timer will deduct 10 seconds. After all 5 questions are answered, the time remaining is the final score. 

While creating this quiz, I learned how to better understand functions, variables and addEventListener's.
